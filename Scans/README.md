# LBNL Geochemical data for Andes obsidian sources and artifacts

### Scanned prints of XRF data for South American obsidian artifacts	
### Provided by N. Tripcevich and R. Burger
### Scanned: July/August, 2020 MTB
											
Files contained in this directory are scans of the dot-matrix prints produced by the Archaeometry Group at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and sent to Richard Burger (Yale University).  The printouts contain data produced by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry on obsidian specimens from archaeological sites in South America.  These data are discussed in several publications by Burger and colleagues, including:

* Burger, R. and F. Asaro (1977) Trace element analysis of obsidian artifacts from the Andes: new perspectives on pre-hispanic economic interaction in Peru and Bolivia. Report number: LBL-6343
* Burger, R. and F. Asaro (1993) La distribución y procedencia de artefactos de obsidiana durante el periodo inicial y horizonte temprano. In "Emergencia de la civilizacion en los Andes: ensayos de interpretación", edited by R. L. Burger, pp. 189-264. UNMSM, Lima.
* Burger, R., F. Asaro, and H. Michel. (1984) Appendix E: The source of the obsidian artifacts at Chavin de Huantar. In "The Prehistoric Occupation of Chavin de Huantar, Peru," R.L. Burger, pp. 263-270.

File names consist of the XRF "Run" number assigned by LBNL, with text designating whether the output if from the mid-Z assay (Fe, Cr, Mn, Ti, Ca, V, Zn, Cu, Pb, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ni, K) or the high-Z assay (Sn, Ba, La, Ce).  Calculated elemental abundances are provided for each sample in a given assay.  Each page represents the calculated elemental abundance.  In order to properly scale these abundances to parts per million, they must be multiplied by one million x ten to the power of the exponent given at the end of each line of output (e.g., 1,000,000 X 10 ^ -5; 1,000,000 X 10 ^ -4).  Corresponding spreadsheets for each assay combine both the mid- and high-Z elements, and were produced by manually transcribing the data as given on the printouts and performing the scaling as indicated.  Thus, elemental abundances listed in the spreadsheets are given in PPM.
