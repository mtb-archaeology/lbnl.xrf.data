# LBNL Geochemical Data for Andes Obsidian Sources and Artifacts

This is an R data package containing geochemical data for obsidian artifacts and sources located in Andean South America.  These data were generated using X-ray fluorescence at the Nuclear Archaeology Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in collaboration with Richard Burger of Yale University.

## Description

This R data package contains X-ray fluorescence data generated from artifacts and source samples of obsidian collected from various sites and geological sources in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador.  These data were generated using X-ray fluorescence at the Nuclear Archaeology Program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in collaboration with Richard Burger of Yale University.  

Data were originally printed directly from the LBNL CDC 7600 mainframe.  In 2019, Burger provided copies of these printouts to Nico Tripcevich (University of California---Berkeley).  Tripcevich transferred them to Matthew T. Boulanger (Southern Methodist University) for integration into Boulanger's previous work on LBNL archaeometric data.  Boulanger transcribed data from these printouts to produce this data package.

## Installing

This data package can be downloaded directly from GitHub, or installed remotely through R using the following command:
